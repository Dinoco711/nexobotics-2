# Nexobotics AI Chatbot

## Overview
The Nexobotics AI Chatbot is an interactive assistant designed to enhance customer satisfaction through seamless, personalized, and efficient experiences. It leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) to provide users with instant responses to their queries.

## Functionality Overview
The chatbot operates within the Nexobotics website, providing users with immediate assistance and information. It is designed to handle various customer inquiries, offering responses based on predefined interactions and server-based processing.

## Integration
The chatbot is integrated into the website through the following files:
- **chatbot.js**: Contains the implementation of the chatbot widget, including message handling and server communication.
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that includes the chatbot widget and its styling.

## Features
- **24/7 Availability**: The chatbot is always ready to assist users, providing round-the-clock support.
- **Natural Conversations**: Utilizes advanced NLP for human-like interactions, enhancing user engagement.
- **Multi-language Support**: Capable of connecting with users globally in their preferred language.

## Technical Details
The chatbot is initialized when the webpage loads, creating a chat interface that allows users to send messages. The messages are processed and sent to a server for response generation. The server's URL can be modified in the `ChatbotWidget` class within `chatbot.js`:
```javascript
class ChatbotWidget {
    constructor(serverUrl = 'https://nexobotics-chatbot.onrender.com/chat') {
        this.serverUrl = serverUrl;
        this.initialize();
    }
}
```

## Error Handling
The chatbot is designed to handle errors gracefully. If an error occurs while processing a message, the chatbot will inform the user with a relevant error message.
